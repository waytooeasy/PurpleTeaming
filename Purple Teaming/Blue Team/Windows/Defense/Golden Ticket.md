	Desc:
	
		The `Kerberos Golden Ticket` is an attack in which threat agents can create/generate tickets for any user in the Domain, therefore effectively acting as a Domain Controller.

		When a Domain is created, the unique user account `krbtgt` is created by default; `krbtgt` is a disabled account that cannot be deleted, renamed, or enabled. The Domain Controller's KDC service will use the password of `krbtgt` to derive a key with which it signs all Kerberos tickets. This password's hash is the most trusted object in the entire Domain because it is how objects guarantee that the environment's Domain issued Kerberos tickets.

		Therefore, `any user` possessing the password's hash of `krbtgt` can create valid Kerberos TGTs. Because `krbtgt` signs them, forged TGTs are considered valid tickets within an environment. Previously, it was even possible to create TGTs for inexistent users and assign any privileges to their accounts. Because the password's hash of `krbtgt` signs these tickets, the entire domain blindly trusts them, behaving as if the user(s) existed and possessed the privileges inscribed in the ticket.

		The `Golden Ticket` attack allows us to escalate rights from any child domain to the parent in the same forest. Therefore, we can escalate to the production domain from any test domain we may have, as the domain is `not` a security boundary.

		This attack provides means for elevated persistence in the domain. It occurs after an adversary has gained Domain Admin (or similar) privileges.

	Prevention:
	
		Preventing the creation of forged tickets is difficult as the `KDC` generates valid tickets using the same procedure. Therefore, once an attacker has all the required information, they can forge a ticket. Nonetheless, there are a few things we can and should do:
	
		- Block privileged users from authenticating to any device.
		- Periodically reset the password of the `krbtgt` account; the secrecy of this hash value is crucial to Active Directory. When resetting the password of `krbtgt` (regardless of the password's strength), it will always be overwritten with a new randomly generated and cryptographically secure one. Utilizing Microsoft's script for changing the password of `krbtgt` [KrbtgtKeys.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/New-KrbtgtKeys.ps1) is highly recommended as it has an audit mode that checks the domain for preventing impacts upon password change. It also forces DC replication across the globe so all Domain Controllers sync the new value instantly, reducing potential business disruptions.
		- Enforce `SIDHistory` filtering between the domains in forests to prevent the escalation from a child domain to a parent domain (because the escalation path involves abusing the `SIDHistory` property by setting it to that of a privileged group, for example, `Enterprise Admins`). However, doing this may result in potential issues in migrating domains.

	Detection

		Correlating users' behavior is the best technique to detect abuse of forged tickets. Suppose we know the location and time a user regularly uses to log in. In that case, it will be easy to alert on other (suspicious) behaviorsâ€”for example, consider the account 'Administrator' in the attack described above. If a mature organization uses `Privileged Access Workstations` (`PAWs`), they should be alert to any privileged users not authenticating from those machines, proactively monitoring events with the ID `4624` and `4625` (successful and failed logon).
		
		Domain Controllers will not log events when a threat agent forges a `Golden Ticket` from a compromised machine. However, when attempting to access another system(s), we will see events for successful logon originating from the compromised machine.

	Note
	
		If an Active Directory forest has been compromised, we need to reset all users' passwords and revoke all certificates, and for `krbtgt`, we must reset its password twice (in `every domain`). The password history value for the `krbtgt` account is 2. Therefore it stores the two most recent passwords. By resetting the password twice, we effectively clear any old passwords from the history, so there is no way another DC will replicate this DC by using an old password. However, it is recommended that this password reset occur at least 10 hours apart from each other (maximum user ticket lifetime); otherwise, expect some services to break if done in a shorter period.
